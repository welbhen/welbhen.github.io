  "career": "I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with an exchange program period at Syracuse University (USA) and an MBA in Project Management. I am proactive, organized, with excellent communication, project management and logical reasoning skills. Last year I decided to transition my career to a more promising market such as web development and software engineering in order to follow my passion for technology, market tendencies and seek for a better long-term career. I am currently working as a self-employed electrical engineer with more than 3 years of experience in this area. I provide solar PV companies with electrical projects, diagrams, technical drawings on autoCAD 2D, 3D simulations using PVSol and training in many subjects of electrical PV projects. I  am responsible for gathering documentations, designing plants, working with deadlines in order to deliver projects on time to the final clients and manage budgets to improve my clientâ€™s profits. I, also, have experience managing teams of electricians, working with field work deadlines, safety and as-built projects. I am a professional with no fear of challenges, always tuned for new technologies and in constant learning."
